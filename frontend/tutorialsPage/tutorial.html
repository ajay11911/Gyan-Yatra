        <h4>What is OOPS?</h4>
        <p>
          Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that
          organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than
          functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has
          unique attributes and behavior. OOP focuses on the objects that
          developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to
          manipulate them. This approach to programming is well suited for
          software that is large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
          This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile
          applications. For example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system
          simulation software.
        </p>

        <h4>What is the structure of object-oriented programming?</h4>

        <p>
          The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming
          include the following: Classes are user-defined data types that act as
          the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods. Objects
          are instances of a class created with specifically defined data.
          Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.
          When class is defined initially, the description is the only object
          that is defined. Methods are functions that objects can perform. They
          are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.
          Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to
          an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an
          object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for
          reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at
          a time. Attributes represent the state of an object. In other words,
          they are the characteristics that distinguish classes. Objects have
          data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the
          class itself and are defined in the class template.
        </p>

        <h4>What are the main principles of OOPS?</h4>
        <p>
          What are the main principles of OOP? Object-oriented programming is
          based on the following principles: Encapsulation. The encapsulation
          principle states that all important information is contained inside an
          object and only select information is exposed. The implementation and
          state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. Other
          objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make
          changes. They are only able to call a list of public functions or
          methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program
          security and avoids unintended data corruption. Abstraction. Objects
          only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other
          objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. The derived class
          can have its functionality extended. This concept can help developers
          more easily make additional changes or additions over time.
          Inheritance. Classes can reuse code and properties from other classes.
          Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling
          developers to reuse common logic, while still maintaining a unique
          hierarchy. Inheritance forces more thorough data analysis, reduces
          development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy. Polymorphism.
          Objects are designed to share behaviors, and they can take on more
          than one form. The program determines which meaning or usage is
          necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class,
          reducing the need to duplicate code. A child class is then created,
          which extends the functionality of the parent class. Polymorphism
          enables different types of objects to pass through the same interface.
          Syntax. This is the set of rules that define how words and punctuation
          are organized in a programming language.

      <div class="desc-container" id="html-course">
        <div class="heading">HTML</div>

        <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
        <p>
          HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language HTML is the standard markup
          language for creating Web pages HTML describes the structure of a Web
          page HTML consists of a series of elements HTML elements tell the
          browser how to display the content HTML elements label pieces of
          content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a
          link", etc.
        </p>

        <h4>HTML document</h4>
        <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt.

The HTML document itself begins with &lthtml&gt and ends with &lt/html&gt.

The visible part of the HTML document is between and &ltbody&gt and &lt/body&gt.
</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

      <div class="desc-container" id="graph-course">
        <div class="heading">GRAPH</div>
        <h4>What is GRAPH?</h4>
        <p>
          A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and
          edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the
          edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More
          formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of
          edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).
        </p>
        <h4>Components of Graph</h4>
        <p>
          Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes,
          vertices are also known as vertices or nodes. Every node/vertex can be
          labeled or unlabelled. Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two
          nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed
          graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are
          no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be
          labeled/unlabelled.
        </p>
        <h4>Types of Graph</h4>
        <p>
          Null Graph: A graph is known as a null graph if there are no edges in
          the graph. Trivial Graph: Graph having only a single vertex, it is
          also the smallest graph possible. Undirected Graph: A graph in which
          edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs
          in the definition of every edge. Directed Graph: A graph in which edge
          has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition
          of every edge. Connected Graph: The graph in which from one node we
          can visit any other node in the graph is known as a connected graph.
          Disconnected Graph: The graph in which at least one node is not
          reachable from a node is known as a disconnected graph. Regular Graph:
          The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to K is called
          K regular graph. Complete Graph: The graph in which from each node
          there is an edge to each other node.

      <div class="desc-container" id="dsa-course">
        <div class="heading">DSA</div>
        <h4>What is DSA?</h4>
        <p>
          DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms) is defined as a combination of two
          separate yet interrelated topics – Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA
          is one of the most important skills that every computer science
          student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of
          these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack
          the interviews of almost every tech giant.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Algorithm?</h4>
        <p>
          Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions
          that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or
          perform a specific type of calculation. To explain it in simpler
          terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to
          execute a task
        </p>
        <h4>How to start learning DSA?</h4>
        <p>
          The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into
          little pieces which need to be done sequentially. The complete process
          to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:
          <li>Learn about Time and Space complexities</li>
          <li>Learn the basics of individual Data Structures</li>
          <li>Learn the basics of Algorithms</li>
          <li>Practice Problems on DSA</li>

      <div class="desc-container" id="c-course">
        <div class="heading">C/C++</div>
        <h4>What is C++?</h4>
        <p>
          C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a generic programming language for building
          software. It’s an object-oriented language. In other words, it
          emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects)
          rather than logic or functions. A common example of an object is a
          user account on a website. Typically, a user account contains closely
          related data like first name, last name, and email address. Bundling
          this information together into an object makes it easy to replicate
          the process of creating a new account.
        </p>
        <h4>What is C++ used for?</h4>
        <p>
          Over time, C++ has become a choice language for building fast and
          reliable software. Its versatility makes it an excellent match for
          complex applications, embedded systems, and internet of things (IoT)
          devices. A few of its most common use cases are as follows: Software
          engineering. A couple of applications you might use daily that were
          created with C plus-plus include Netflix and Amazon. Operating system
          (OS) development. Examples of OS that were created with C++ include
          Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS. Graphical user interfaces. C++
          is often recommended for graphical user interface design or, GUI.
          Virtual reality (VR). C++ can be an excellent language to learn if you
          want to develop VR applications. Blockchain technology. The well-known
          cryptocurrency Bitcoin was developed in C++. It can also be used to
          create smart contracts. Game development. You can develop games and
          gaming consoles with C++. For example, the game World of Warcraft and
          the Xbox console.
        </p>
        <h4>Advantages of C++</h4>
        <p>
          Programming in C++ offers several advantages. Because it is object
          oriented, you can easily organize and classify the code. Instead of
          rewriting code from scratch, you can reuse it. You can also use C
          plus-plus to interact directly with a computer’s hardware. As a
          result, you'll be able to control how a system uses its computational
          resources, like software, hardware, and memory.

        <h4>What is java?</h4>
        <p>
          Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
          designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is
          intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere
          (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
          support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first
          released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for
          desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity,
          robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for
          enterprise-level applications.

        <h4>JAVA Terminology</h4>
        <p>
          Java Terminology Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these
          common terms of Java. <br /><br />

          1. Java Virtual Machine(JVM): This is generally referred to as JVM.
          There are three execution phases of a program. They are written,
          compile and run the program. Writing a program is done by a java
          programmer like you and me. The compilation is done by the JAVAC
          compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java
          development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and
          generates bytecode as output. In the Running phase of a program, JVM
          executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. Now, we understood
          that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode
          produced by the compiler. Every Operating System has a different JVM
          but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the
          same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a
          platform-independent language.
          <br /><br />
          2. Bytecode in the Development Process: As discussed, the Javac
          compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it
          can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler. To
          view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used. <br /><br />
          3. Java Development Kit(JDK): While we were using the term JDK when we
          learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a
          complete Java development kit that includes everything including
          compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs,
          etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our
          computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.
          <br /><br />
          4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE): JDK includes JRE. JRE installation
          on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot
          compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins.
          For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.
          <br /><br />
          5. Garbage Collector: In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects.
          To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage
          Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not
          referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling
          memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their
          code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long
          time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being
          referenced.
